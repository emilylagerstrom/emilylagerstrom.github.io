<h5> Advice to my readers: </h5>

<p> The time in high school that is played doing the sports you love goes by too fast.  Cherish every  moment, every win, every pre game ritual, and every memory you've made with your teammates. Practicing the sport you love is most important to become successful.  Even though you want to skip that day of practice, it is important that you fit time in every day to work on something that you aren't the best in.  It will be rewarding.</p>
